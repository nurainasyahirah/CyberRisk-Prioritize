        <h1 class="text-center">IoT Vulnerabilities</h1>
        <p class="text-center">
            Internet of Things (IoT) devices are increasingly targeted for cyber-attacks due to weak security configurations, limited updates, and accessible locations. Understanding these vulnerabilities is essential to protect IoT environments effectively.
        </p>

        <h2>Key IoT Vulnerabilities</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <p><strong>Weak Authentication and Authorization:</strong> Lack of strong authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), makes it easier for attackers to gain unauthorized access.</p>
            <p><strong>Unencrypted Data Transmission:</strong> IoT devices that do not encrypt data can expose sensitive information to interception.</p>
            <p><strong>Inadequate Patch Management:</strong> Many IoT devices lack regular updates, leaving them vulnerable to known security flaws.</p>
            <p><strong>Poor Physical Security:</strong> IoT devices in accessible locations are vulnerable to tampering or unauthorized access.</p>
            <p><strong>Insecure APIs:</strong> If APIs used by IoT devices are insecure, they can expose devices to attacks and data leaks.</p>
            <p><strong>Hardcoded Credentials:</strong> Devices with default usernames and passwords are easy targets for attackers.</p>
            <p><strong>Insufficient Security Configurations:</strong> Devices with weak or disabled security settings remain exposed if users donâ€™t change these defaults.</p>
            <p><strong>Device Constraints:</strong> Limited processing power in IoT devices restricts their ability to implement strong security measures.</p>
            <p><strong>Network Vulnerabilities:</strong> Shared network connections may expose IoT devices if the network itself is insecure.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Common IoT Attacks Exploiting Vulnerabilities</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <p><strong>DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service):</strong> Compromised IoT devices are used in botnets to overwhelm target servers with traffic.</p>
            <p><strong>Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):</strong> Attackers intercept and manipulate data transmitted between IoT devices and servers.</p>
            <p><strong>Device Hijacking:</strong> Attackers gain control of an IoT device to access data or use it for malicious purposes.</p>
            <p><strong>Firmware Manipulation:</strong> Altering IoT device firmware can lead to unauthorized control or data breaches.</p>
            <p><strong>Ransomware Attacks:</strong> Ransomware targeting IoT devices can lock them down and demand ransom for access restoration.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>How to Mitigate IoT Vulnerabilities</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <p><strong>Use Strong Authentication:</strong> Implement complex passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IoT devices.</p>
            <p><strong>Encrypt Data Transmission:</strong> Ensure all data sent between IoT devices and networks is encrypted to prevent interception.</p>
            <p><strong>Implement Regular Patching:</strong> Update firmware regularly and apply patches to address security flaws.</p>
            <p><strong>Change Default Credentials:</strong> Replace default usernames and passwords with strong, unique credentials.</p>
            <p><strong>Use Secure Networks:</strong> Connect IoT devices to private networks with firewalls and isolate them from critical systems.</p>
            <p><strong>Monitor for Suspicious Activity:</strong> Use intrusion detection systems (IDS) to detect unusual behavior from IoT devices.</p>
            <p><strong>Network Segmentation:</strong> Segment IoT devices on a separate network to limit the damage if a device is compromised.</p>
            <p><strong>Select Secure IoT Devices:</strong> Choose reputable devices with strong security practices and regular updates.</p>
