        <h1 class="text-center">Zero-Day Exploits</h1>
        <p class="text-center">
            A zero-day exploit is a cyberattack that takes advantage of a software vulnerability unknown to the vendor. Because there’s no patch available, zero-day exploits can cause significant harm and are highly sought after by attackers.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Characteristics of Zero-Day Exploits</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <p><strong>Unpatched Vulnerability:</strong> Targets a vulnerability that hasn't been fixed by the software provider, giving attackers a “zero-day” advantage.</p>
            <p><strong>High Impact:</strong> Zero-day exploits can cause substantial damage because they often remain undetected until after an attack has occurred.</p>
            <p><strong>Exclusivity:</strong> Zero-day exploits are valuable and often used by nation-states or sophisticated cybercriminal groups to target high-value systems.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>How Zero-Day Exploits Work</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <p><strong>Discovery of a Vulnerability:</strong> Attackers or researchers find an unknown flaw in a system. If attackers find the flaw first, they can develop an exploit to take advantage of it.</p>
            <p><strong>Development of Exploit Code:</strong> Attackers create malicious code that leverages the vulnerability, which could involve data theft, remote control, or malware distribution.</p>
            <p><strong>Deployment of Attack:</strong> Attackers use methods like phishing emails, compromised websites, or malicious downloads to deliver the exploit to the target.</p>
            <p><strong>Exploitation:</strong> Once the exploit is in place, attackers gain unauthorized access, steal data, or control the system as long as the vulnerability remains unpatched.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Common Types of Zero-Day Attacks</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <p><strong>Zero-Day Malware:</strong> Malware designed to exploit a zero-day vulnerability, potentially including ransomware, spyware, or viruses.</p>
            <p><strong>Zero-Day Vulnerability Exploits:</strong> These are specific attacks on unpatched flaws in popular software or operating systems.</p>
            <p><strong>Zero-Day Network Exploits:</strong> These exploit vulnerabilities in network devices or protocols, potentially allowing access to corporate networks.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>How to Defend Against Zero-Day Exploits</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <p><strong>Use Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):</strong> IDS can monitor network traffic for patterns or anomalies associated with zero-day attacks.</p>
            <p><strong>Behavioral Analysis and Threat Intelligence:</strong> Advanced tools use behavioral analysis and machine learning to detect unusual activities that may indicate a zero-day exploit.</p>
            <p><strong>Frequent Software Updates:</strong> Keeping software up-to-date reduces the risk of zero-day exploits by closing known vulnerabilities.</p>
            <p><strong>Endpoint Protection:</strong> Next-generation antivirus and endpoint detection tools analyze file behavior in real-time, blocking suspicious activities.</p>
            <p><strong>Network Segmentation:</strong> Segmenting networks limits the spread of an exploit, containing potential damage.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Responding to Zero-Day Exploits</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <p><strong>Patch Management:</strong> Apply patches immediately after a vulnerability is discovered and fixed to prevent further exposure.</p>
            <p><strong>Incident Response:</strong> Develop a response plan that includes detecting, isolating, and mitigating exploits.</p>
            <p><strong>Communication with Vendors:</strong> Informing vendors about discovered vulnerabilities helps them create patches and reduce risks.</p>
        </div>
